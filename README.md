# nba-bot-reddit
nba-bot in development. Will be functional on Reddit.

Goal of this bot is so that in certain subreddits simply typing out an NBA player's name plus a specific year will prompt a bot to respond with that player's basic per game stats. Will add more to this README as the project scope becomes more defined.
